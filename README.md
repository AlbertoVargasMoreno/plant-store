## Updates

'till now I've done some changes, and the unfortune has choosen us as its victims:
 
 - I'm unable to link an image locally stored: I get the warn `Invalid source`; that makes me sad :C
 - it works with urls, so I don't have any idea why it has problems with local stored files `¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø`
 
 branch `glightbox-text` 

 I like it!!, works fine, the only regret I have is that needs to download 2 extra files, but it's ok for now

 in `hacking-up`:

 I am happy, with the results, a good looking menu, and the lightbox functionality

 simple animations added
